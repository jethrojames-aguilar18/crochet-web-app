![Alt Text](banner-logo.png))


## Overview
This proposal outlines our strategy for designing and developing a bespoke website for our crochet business, aimed at establishing a strong online presence and enhancing sales. The project will feature a custom website design that is user-friendly, responsive, and aligned with our brand identity. Key functionalities will include a login/signup page for personalized user experiences, along with a home page showcasing our offerings. Customers will have the ability to post requests for custom crafts, browse available custom designs and premade items, and choose between collaborative or individual crafting options. Additionally, users can easily add items to their cart and utilize a checkout system, including the ability to cancel orders if needed. An order section will facilitate efficient tracking of purchases, while a cash-on-delivery payment option will provide flexibility for our customers. Finally, a feedback section will encourage customer reviews and suggestions, allowing us to continually improve our services. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the customer experience while effectively promoting our crochet products.
